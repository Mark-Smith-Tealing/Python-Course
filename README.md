# Introduction to Python
Mark Smith

These are the materials for 'Introduction to Python', an online Python course that I created and taught from 2021 and continue to teach throught early 2022 to children aged 8-13. Here is an outline of the course:

- Lesson 1 – Getting Started: Introduction and Arithmetic Operators
- Lesson 2 – Types and Variables 
- Lesson 3 – Functions
- Lesson 4 – Conditional Statements 
- Lesson 5 – Further Conditionals and Recursion
- Lesson 6 – Functions with Return Values
- Lesson 7 – Loops, Lists and Turtles
- Lesson 8 – Project
- Lesson 9 - Review
- Lesson 10 - Strings
- Lesson 11 - Word Play
- Block 3 Week 1 - Variable and Basic Function Review
- Block 3 Week 2 - More Complex Function Review I
- Block 3 Week 3 - More Complex Function Review II

Each lesson consists of a Powerpoint presentation and jupyter notebook. Initially, I ran the course using Spyder with PDF exercise sheets, which can be found alongside the materials of each lesson. In my second iteration of the course, I found that Jupyter Notebooks provide a more intuitive coding environment. Hence, the PDF documents are attached only for completeness. 

The course was taught in 10-week blocks, with Lessons 1-8 comprising the first block. Lessons 9-11 comprising the second block and those titled Block3-Weekx- comprise the third block of classes. 

Some questions were taken from [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey. While the project from lesson 8 consisted of a code explanation snake from the module [Freegames](https://pypi.org/project/freegames/).
