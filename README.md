# Python-Course

These are the materials for Introduction to Python, an online Python course that I taught online 2021-2022 to children aged 8-13. Here is an outline of the course:

- Lesson 1 – Getting Started: Introduction and Arithmetic Operators
- Lesson 2 – Types and Variables 
- Lesson 3 – Functions
- Lesson 4 – Conditional Statements 
- Lesson 5 – Further Conditionals and Recursion
- Lesson 6 – Functions with Return Values
- Lesson 7 – Loops, Lists and Turtles
- Lesson 8 – Project 

Each lesson consists of a Powerpoint presentation and jupyter notebook. Initially, I ran the course using Spyder with PDF exercise sheets, which can be found alongside the materials of each lesson. In my second iteration of the course, I found that Jupyter Notebooks provide a more intuitive coding environment. Hence, the PDF documents are attached only for completeness. 

Some questions were taken from [Think Python 2nd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey. While the project from lesson 8 consisted of a code explanation snake from the module [Freegames](https://pypi.org/project/freegames/).
